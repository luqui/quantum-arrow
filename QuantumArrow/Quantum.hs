-- |The Operator arrow is half of a Quantum arrow: it represents
-- the "parallel" nature of quantum computations, but only handles
-- choice in a "pure" way; that is, if you have:
--
-- > if x > 0
-- >     then opLift print -< "Hello"
-- >     else opLift print -< "Goodbye"
--
-- Then if x represents a superposition of both positive and
-- negative numbers, both "Hello" and "Goodbye" will be printed
-- (x taking on positive values in the then branch and negative
-- values in the else branch).  This is leveraged by the Quantum
-- arrow to do proper branch collapsation.
--
-- It is implemented as a function from quantum states to quantum
-- states (under some MonadRandom for selection).  But the states are augmented
-- by a dummy parameter 'd' to keep track of the relationship between
-- the input and the output.  So if the value |1> generated the value
-- |"foo"> in the output, then we know that when we collapse the
-- input to 1, whatever the output of this computation was has to
-- be collapsed to "foo" simultaneously.  The dummy parameter
-- implements entanglement!
